The Java Tutorials have been written for JDK 8. Examples and practices
described in this page don't take advantage of improvements introduced
in later releases.


  The if-then and if-then-else Statements


    The |if-then| Statement

The |if-then| statement is the most basic of all the control flow
statements. It tells your program to execute a certain section of code
/only if/ a particular test evaluates to |true|. For example, the
|Bicycle| class could allow the brakes to decrease the bicycle's speed
/only if/ the bicycle is already in motion. One possible implementation
of the |applyBrakes| method could be as follows:

void applyBrakes() {
    // the "if" clause: bicycle must be moving
    if (isMoving){ 
        // the "then" clause: decrease current speed
        currentSpeed--;
    }
}

If this test evaluates to |false| (meaning that the bicycle is not in
motion), control jumps to the end of the |if-then| statement.

In addition, the opening and closing braces are optional, provided that
the "then" clause contains only one statement:

void applyBrakes() {
    // same as above, but without braces 
    if (isMoving)
        currentSpeed--;
}

Deciding when to omit the braces is a matter of personal taste. Omitting
them can make the code more brittle. If a second statement is later
added to the "then" clause, a common mistake would be forgetting to add
the newly required braces. The compiler cannot catch this sort of error;
you'll just get the wrong results.


    The |if-then-else| Statement

The |if-then-else| statement provides a secondary path of execution when
an "if" clause evaluates to |false|. You could use an |if-then-else|
statement in the |applyBrakes| method to take some action if the brakes
are applied when the bicycle is not in motion. In this case, the action
is to simply print an error message stating that the bicycle has already
stopped.

void applyBrakes() {
    if (isMoving) {
        currentSpeed--;
    } else {
        System.err.println("The bicycle has already stopped!");
    } 
}

The following program, |IfElseDemo|
<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/examples/IfElseDemo.java>,
assigns a grade based on the value of a test score: an A for a score of
90% or above, a B for a score of 80% or above, and so on.


class IfElseDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int testscore = 76;
        char grade;

        if (testscore >= 90) {
            grade = 'A';
        } else if (testscore >= 80) {
            grade = 'B';
        } else if (testscore >= 70) {
            grade = 'C';
        } else if (testscore >= 60) {
            grade = 'D';
        } else {
            grade = 'F';
        }
        System.out.println("Grade = " + grade);
    }
}

The output from the program is:

    Grade = C

You may have noticed that the value of |testscore| can satisfy more than
one expression in the compound statement: |76 >= 70| and |76 >= 60|.
However, once a condition is satisfied, the appropriate statements are
executed |(grade = 'C';)| and the remaining conditions are not evaluated.
