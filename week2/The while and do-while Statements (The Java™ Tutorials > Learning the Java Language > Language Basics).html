The Java Tutorials have been written for JDK 8. Examples and practices
described in this page don't take advantage of improvements introduced
in later releases.


  The while and do-while Statements

The |while| statement continually executes a block of statements while a
particular condition is |true|. Its syntax can be expressed as:

while (expression) {
     statement(s)
}

The |while| statement evaluates /expression/, which must return a
|boolean| value. If the expression evaluates to |true|, the |while|
statement executes the /statement/(s) in the |while| block. The |while|
statement continues testing the expression and executing its block until
the expression evaluates to |false|. Using the |while| statement to
print the values from 1 through 10 can be accomplished as in the
following |WhileDemo|
<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/examples/WhileDemo.java>
program:


class WhileDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int count = 1;
        while (count < 11) {
            System.out.println("Count is: " + count);
            count++;
        }
    }
}

You can implement an infinite loop using the |while| statement as follows:

while (true){
    // your code goes here
}

The Java programming language also provides a |do-while| statement,
which can be expressed as follows:

do {
     statement(s)
} while (expression);

The difference between |do-while| and |while| is that |do-while|
evaluates its expression at the bottom of the loop instead of the top.
Therefore, the statements within the |do| block are always executed at
least once, as shown in the following |DoWhileDemo|
<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/examples/DoWhileDemo.java>
program:


class DoWhileDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int count = 1;
        do {
            System.out.println("Count is: " + count);
            count++;
        } while (count < 11);
    }
}
