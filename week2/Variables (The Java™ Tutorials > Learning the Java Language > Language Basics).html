The Java Tutorials have been written for JDK 8. Examples and practices
described in this page don't take advantage of improvements introduced
in later releases.


  Variables

As you learned in the previous lesson, an object stores its state in
/fields/.

int *cadence* = 0;
int *speed* = 0;
int *gear* = 1;

The What Is an Object?
<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/object.html>
discussion introduced you to fields, but you probably have still a few
questions, such as: What are the rules and conventions for naming a
field? Besides |int|, what other data types are there? Do fields have to
be initialized when they are declared? Are fields assigned a default
value if they are not explicitly initialized? We'll explore the answers
to such questions in this lesson, but before we do, there are a few
technical distinctions you must first become aware of. In the Java
programming language, the terms "field" and "variable" are both used;
this is a common source of confusion among new developers, since both
often seem to refer to the same thing.

The Java programming language defines the following kinds of variables:

  * *Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields)* Technically speaking,
    objects store their individual states in "non-static fields", that
    is, fields declared without the |static| keyword. Non-static fields
    are also known as /instance variables/ because their values are
    unique to each /instance/ of a class (to each object, in other
    words); the |currentSpeed| of one bicycle is independent from the
    |currentSpeed| of another.
  * *Class Variables (Static Fields)* A /class variable/ is any field
    declared with the |static| modifier; this tells the compiler that
    there is exactly one copy of this variable in existence, regardless
    of how many times the class has been instantiated. A field defining
    the number of gears for a particular kind of bicycle could be marked
    as |static| since conceptually the same number of gears will apply
    to all instances. The code |static int numGears = 6;| would create
    such a static field. Additionally, the keyword |final| could be
    added to indicate that the number of gears will never change.
  * *Local Variables* Similar to how an object stores its state in
    fields, a method will often store its temporary state in /local
    variables/. The syntax for declaring a local variable is similar to
    declaring a field (for example, |int count = 0;|). There is no
    special keyword designating a variable as local; that determination
    comes entirely from the location in which the variable is declared —
    which is between the opening and closing braces of a method. As
    such, local variables are only visible to the methods in which they
    are declared; they are not accessible from the rest of the class.
  * *Parameters* You've already seen examples of parameters, both in the
    |Bicycle| class and in the |main| method of the "Hello World!"
    application. Recall that the signature for the |main| method is
    |public static void main(String[] args)|. Here, the |args| variable
    is the parameter to this method. The important thing to remember is
    that parameters are always classified as "variables" not "fields".
    This applies to other parameter-accepting constructs as well (such
    as constructors and exception handlers) that you'll learn about
    later in the tutorial.

Having said that, the remainder of this tutorial uses the following
general guidelines when discussing fields and variables. If we are
talking about "fields in general" (excluding local variables and
parameters), we may simply say "fields". If the discussion applies to
"all of the above", we may simply say "variables". If the context calls
for a distinction, we will use specific terms (static field, local
variables, etc.) as appropriate. You may also occasionally see the term
"member" used as well. A type's fields, methods, and nested types are
collectively called its /members/.


    Naming

Every programming language has its own set of rules and conventions for
the kinds of names that you're allowed to use, and the Java programming
language is no different. The rules and conventions for naming your
variables can be summarized as follows:

  * Variable names are case-sensitive. A variable's name can be any
    legal identifier — an unlimited-length sequence of Unicode letters
    and digits, beginning with a letter, the dollar sign "|$|", or the
    underscore character "|_|". The convention, however, is to always
    begin your variable names with a letter, not "|$|" or "|_|".
    Additionally, the dollar sign character, by convention, is never
    used at all. You may find some situations where auto-generated names
    will contain the dollar sign, but your variable names should always
    avoid using it. A similar convention exists for the underscore
    character; while it's technically legal to begin your variable's
    name with "|_|", this practice is discouraged. White space is not
    permitted.
  * Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or
    underscore characters. Conventions (and common sense) apply to this
    rule as well. When choosing a name for your variables, use full
    words instead of cryptic abbreviations. Doing so will make your code
    easier to read and understand. In many cases it will also make your
    code self-documenting; fields named |cadence|, |speed|, and |gear|,
    for example, are much more intuitive than abbreviated versions, such
    as |s|, |c|, and |g|. Also keep in mind that the name you choose
    must not be a keyword or reserved word
    <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/_keywords.html>.
  * If the name you choose consists of only one word, spell that word in
    all lowercase letters. If it consists of more than one word,
    capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word. The names
    |gearRatio| and |currentGear| are prime examples of this convention.
    If your variable stores a constant value, such as |static final int
    NUM_GEARS = 6|, the convention changes slightly, capitalizing every
    letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore
    character. By convention, the underscore character is never used
    elsewhere.
